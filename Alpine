By default ALSA has all channels muted. Those have to be unmuted manually.

Unmute with amixer
Unmuting the sound card's master volume can be done by using amixer:

$ amixer sset Master unmute
$ amixer sset Speaker unmute
$ amixer sset Headphone unmute

Unmute with alsamixer
Unmuting the sound card can be done using alsamixer:

$ alsamixer
The MM label below a channel indicates that the channel is muted, and OO indicates that it is open.

Scroll to the Master and PCM channels with the ← and → keys and unmute them by pressing the m key.

Use the ↑ key to increase the volume and obtain a value of 0 dB gain. The gain can be found in the upper left next to the Item: field.
